# Supervised Learning Project: Linear Regression

This project develops an interpretable linear regression model to help ReCell, a startup operating in the refurbished electronics market, predict the resale price of used smartphones and tablets. Through data cleaning, feature engineering, statistical analysis, and regression diagnostics, the project identifies key technical specifications that significantly influence second-hand market value. 
The model is designed with a focus on both accuracy and business interpretability, supporting ReCell in building a dynamic, data-driven pricing strategy.
Note: the model is implemented with a focus on statistics and supervised learning rather than code proficiency.
